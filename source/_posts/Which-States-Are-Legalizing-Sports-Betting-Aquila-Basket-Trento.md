     which states are legalizing sports betting? So far, six states have finalized legislation to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). Those states are New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Additionally, several other states are considering legalization measures. Here is a rundown of where things currently stand:  New Jersey was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court’s decision in May. The Garden State had been fighting for years to overturn PASPA so that it could allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. On June 11th – just two weeks after the SCOTUS ruling – Governor Phil Murphy signed into law a bill authorizing sports betting at casinos and racetracks. The first bets were placed on July 14th at Monmouth Park Racetrack. In Delaware, lawmakers authorized three casino licensees to offer full-service sports gambling on June 5th – less than a week after the Supreme Court’s ruling. Bettors can now place wagers at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, Harrington Raceway & Casino and Delaware Park Racetrack & Slots in Wilmington. Mississippi became the third state to legalize sports gambling on July 17th when Governor Phil Bryant signed a bill into law that allows casinos in the state to offer betting on professional and college sports. The law will go into effect on August 1st. West Virginia was next up, passing legislation to allow sports betting on August 7th. The bill allows both mobile and in-person wagering and gives the state’s three casino operators – Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Mountaineer Casino Racetrack & Resort and Mardi Gras Casino & Resort – 90 days from the start of the legislative session (which began in January) to apply for licenses. On August 15th, Pennsylvania followed suit by passing legislation to allow both online and land-based sports betting within its borders. The bill now awaits approval from Governor Tom Wolf, who has said he will sign it into law. Finally, Rhode Island became the sixth state to legalize sports gambling when Governor Gina Raimondo signed a bill into law on August 22nd. The new law allows for both online and brick-and-mortar sports betting at casinos in the state. It also permits mobile sports wagering but does not allow bets on college games or events taking place in Rhode Island. Several other states are also considering legalization measures including New York, Michigan and Illinois.

#  New Jersey Becomes The Latest State To Legalize Sports Betting 

New Jersey became the latest state to legalize sports betting on Monday, following a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that overturned a federal law prohibiting most states from allowing it.

“Today is a great day for the people of New Jersey and for our nation’s economy,” said Governor Phil Murphy in a statement. “I am proud to sign legislation that will allow people in our state to make legal and responsible bets on sporting events. This is the right move for New Jersey and it will spur economic growth in our state.”

The new law allows casinos and racetracks in New Jersey to offer sports betting, with tax revenue from bets going towards paying for education, infrastructure projects, and other programs.

It is unclear exactly how much revenue sports betting will generate for New Jersey, but some estimates have put the figure at hundreds of millions of dollars per year.

Gambling has been around in some form in the United States since the early 1800s, but the federal government began to crack down on it in the 1960s.

In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively outlawed sports betting outside of Nevada.

But PASPA was overturned by the Supreme Court in May of this year, after a lawsuit brought by New Jersey challenging the law was successful.

This has led to a rush by states to pass legislation legalizing sports betting, with Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia already doing so. More states are expected to follow suit in the coming months.

#  Delaware Becomes Second State To Legalize Sports Betting 

After a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May allowed states to legalize sports betting, Delaware became the second state to do so on June 5th.

The Delaware Lottery Commission officially began taking sports bets at 1:00pm that day at three locations across the state: Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, Harrington Raceway and Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack and Casino.

“I am thrilled that we can offer this experience to our players,” said Vernon Kirk, director of the Delaware Lottery. “We have been preparing for this day for months and are excited to start taking bets.”

To place a bet, customers must be at least 21 years old and must present a valid photo ID. Bets can be placed on professional and college sports, including football, basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer.

The minimum bet is $1, and the maximum bet is $500. The commission will take a 6.75% cut of all winning bets.

Delaware joins Nevada as the only states where sports betting is legal. Several other states are expected to legalize it in the coming months.

#  Nevada and West Virginia Are Poised to Legalize Sports Betting 

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. 
 states have expressed an interest in regulating and taxing sports betting, but Nevada and West Virginia are poised to be the first to legalize it.

The Court’s majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, held that the prohibition on state-authorized sports betting violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves certain powers for the states, including the power to regulate gambling. 

Justice Anthony Kennedy joined Alito’s opinion, but also filed a concurring opinion in which he expressed some concerns about the implications of the ruling. However, he agreed that the federal law was unconstitutional. 

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented. Ginsburg argued that Congress had a rational basis for prohibiting state-authorized sports betting, while Breyer argued that Congress should be allowed to regulate sports betting if it wishes to do so. 

The decision is a major victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting since 2012 to legalize sports betting at its casinos and racetracks. The state argued that the prohibition interfered with its sovereign rights under the Tenth Amendment. 

Monday’s ruling clears the way for other states to follow suit. Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have already passed laws authorizing sports betting within their borders. 

It is estimated that Americans wager over $150 billion on sports each year, most of it illegally. The legalization of sports betting could provide a significant boost to state coffers; New Jersey estimates that it could bring in as much as $100 million in tax revenue annually. 

Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to game fixing and other forms of corruption. But many experts believe that regulation will help mitigate these risks. 

The NFL has come out against legalization, but the NBA and MLB have taken a more neutral stance.

#  Sports Betting Continues to Spread Throughout the United States

Sports betting has been popular in the United States for centuries, but it has only been recently that this form of gambling has started to spread throughout the country. This is largely due to the fact that many states have now legalized sports betting, which has made it easier for people to place bets on their favorite teams.

There are a number of reasons why sports betting has become so popular in the United States. For one, there is the excitement of betting on a game and potentially winning big. Additionally, many people enjoy watching sporting events even if they don't have a horse in the race, and being able to bet on these games allows them to add an extra level of excitement. Finally, sports betting is a great way to make some extra money, provided that you know what you're doing.

If you're thinking about getting into sports betting, there are a few things that you should know. First of all, it's important to do your research and learn about the different types of bets that are available. There are a variety of different wagers that you can make, and each one has its own risks and rewards. Secondly, you need to develop a strategy and stick with it. If you start making rash decisions based on emotion, you're likely to lose money in the long run. Finally, it's important to be patient. It can take time to learn how to bet on sports successfully, but if you put in the effort you will eventually see results.
