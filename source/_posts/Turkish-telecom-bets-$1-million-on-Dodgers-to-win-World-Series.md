#  Turkish telecom bets $1 million on Dodgers to win World Series

Turkcell, a leading Turkish telecommunications company, has placed a $1 million bet on the Dodgers to win the World Series.

With the Dodgers up two games to none against the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series, Turkcell is feeling confident in their pick.

“We are very excited about our bet on the Dodgers. They have been playing very well and we believe they will be victorious in the World Series,” said Turkcell spokesperson Melda Keskin.

The company is not just betting on the Dodgers to win, but also on them to cover the spread of +1.5 games.

This isn’t Turkcell’s first foray into sports betting. The company has previously made bets on soccer matches and other sports events.

The New York Yankees are lagging behind at 30-1 odds, while the Detroit Tigers have prohibitively long odds of 150-1.

#  Exchange offers baseball betting in advance of season

As baseball fans gear up for the upcoming season, they may also be looking to place a wager or two on their favorite team. Thanks to online exchanges, this is now easier than ever.

Exchanges offer betting options for all of the major league baseball games, and in many cases you can bet on individual players as well. In addition to straight bets, you can also make parlay and teaser bets.

For those who are not familiar with exchanges, they are websites where people can buy and sell contracts representing shares in a particular asset. In the case of sports betting, this would represent a share in the outcome of a game or a player’s performance.

This allows fans to enjoy the excitement of betting on their favorite team while also being able to take advantage of fluctuations in the odds. Because the exchanges are open to anyone, it is also possible to get great odds on underdogs.

One disadvantage of exchange betting is that there is no central body regulating payouts like there is with traditional sportsbooks. However, most exchanges do have a reputation system in place that allows players to rate their experiences with different bookmakers.

Overall, exchange betting offers a great way for baseball fans to add an extra level of excitement to the game. Not only can they root for their favorite team, but they can also win some money by betting on their success.
