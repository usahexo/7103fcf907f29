It's been a little more than a week since Stardew Valley was released on the Nintendo Switch and already fans are finding new secrets in the game. Some believe that files hidden in the game suggest that there may be a casino coming to the game in the future.

Odds Onneill, a prominent member of the Stardew Valley modding community and one of the first people to find the hidden files, spoke out about the possible casino on Wednesday.

"There's definitely something there," he said in an interview with IGN. "It's not just a bunch of files sitting on a server somewhere - it looks like it was meant to be part of the game."

Onneill says that he found evidence for both a casino and racetrack in the game's code, but that there's no telling what form either one of those features might take if they're ultimately implemented into Stardew Valley.

The news has excited Stardew Valley fans who have been eagerly awaiting any clues about potential upcoming content for the game. While many assumed that a casino would be added to Stardew Valley eventually, this is the first concrete evidence that such a feature might be in development.
