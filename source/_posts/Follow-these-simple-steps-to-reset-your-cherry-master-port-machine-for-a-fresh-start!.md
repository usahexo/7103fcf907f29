#  How to Reset a Cherry Master Port Machine

The Cherry Master game machines are popular in arcades and casinos. They are often used for gambling games. The reset process for these machines is not difficult, but it is different from the process for most other arcade games.

The first step is to make sure that the machine is turned off. Once it is turned off, unplug it from the wall. Now, you need to locate the two black buttons on the front of the machine. These buttons are located next to the coin door.

Using a pen or paper clip, press and hold the button on the left while you press and hold the button on the right. While you are holding these buttons down, plug the machine back in to the wall. Keep holding both buttons down until you hear a beep sound.

After you hear the beep sound, release both buttons and wait a few seconds for the machine to reset. Once it has reset, turn it back on by pressing the power button. You can now start playing your favorite Cherry Master game again!
