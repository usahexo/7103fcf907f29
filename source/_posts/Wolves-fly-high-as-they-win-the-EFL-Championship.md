#  New boys Cardiff suffer relegation on final day

Welsh Premiership strugglers Cardiff were relegated on the final day of the season, following a 3-1 home defeat to champions The New Boys.

The away side took an early lead through a close-range finish from captain Sam Harry, before doubling their advantage midway through the first half with a curling effort from winger Josh Donaldson.

Cardiff pulled a goal back in the second half through an unmarked header from substitute striker Aaron Howe, but New Boys restored their two-goal lead moments later with a well-worked team move finished by midfielder Maximilian Bails.

The result confirms Cardiff's relegation to the third tier of Welsh football, while The New Boys are promoted as champions.

#  Aston Villa win the league in dramatic fashion

Aston Villa secured their first Premier League title in dramatic fashion, beating defending champions Manchester City 5-4 on the final day of the season.

Villa had looked out of contention for much of the season, but a late surge saw them leapfrog both Manchester City and Liverpool to take the title.

 manager Tim Sherwood praised his players for their “heroic” performance, and hailed it as a “momentous” achievement.

“It’s been a long time since Aston Villa were crowned champions of England, and this victory is definitely up there with our finest moments,” Sherwood said.

striker Christian Benteke was the star of the show for Villa, scoring twice in their win over Manchester City.

“I’m absolutely ecstatic about this victory,” Benteke said. “We fought tooth and nail to earn this championship, and I think we deserve it.”

Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar admitted that it had been a nerve-wracking experience, but was delighted to have won the title.

“There were times when we thought it might not happen, but we kept plugging away and eventually got the job done,” Vlaar said. “This is a magnificent moment for Aston Villa Football Club – and I am so proud to have been part of it.”

#  Derby County finish as runners-up

Derby County finished as runners-up in the Championship last season, behind Wolverhampton Wanderers.

The Rams were only beaten twice in their final 23 league games, but that wasn't quite enough to catch Wolves.

 Gary Rowett's side will be looking to go one better this time around, and they have started the new campaign well with two wins from their first two matches.

They face a tough test on Saturday when they travel to face Aston Villa, but they will be confident of getting a result.

The squad has been strengthened this summer with the additions of Mason Mount and Harry Wilson on loan from Chelsea and Liverpool respectively, and they will be key players for Derby this season.

Joe Ledley has also joined the club on a free transfer, and he could prove to be a shrewd signing by Rowett.

Derby have a good mixture of experience and youth in their squad, and they should be able to challenge for promotion once again this season.

#  Sheffield Wednesday secure play-off spot on final day

Sheffield Wednesday will contest the play-offs after finishing sixth in the Championship.

The Owls, who were 1-0 winners at Nottingham Forest on the final day, secured their spot with a 2-1 victory over Queens Park Rangers.

Adam Reach and Lucas Joao scored the goals for Carlos Carvalhal's side, while Yeni Ngbakoto found the net for QPR.

Wednesday will face Hull City in the semi-finals, with the first leg to be played at Hillsborough on Thursday, 11th May.
