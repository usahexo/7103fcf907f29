#  Can you handle the sugar rush?

Most people would answer that question with a resounding, “No!”. However, for some, the allure of sugar is too strong to resist. With its sweet flavor and addictive properties, it’s no wonder sugar has been called “the most dangerous drug in the world”.

Sugar is a carbohydrate that provides energy for the body. It’s found in many foods we eat, such as candy, cake, cookies, and soft drinks. Sugar can also be found in disguise in foods like ketchup, salad dressing, and bread.

The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) of added sugar per day and men consume no more than 9 teaspoons (36 grams) per day. However, the average American consumes far more than that – about 22 teaspoons (88 grams) per day!

Many people believe that sugar is harmless because it’s natural. However, what we often don’t realize is that sugar is not only added to food, but it is also found in fruit and other natural products. For example, a medium banana contains about 14 grams of sugar. So even if you are eating mostly healthy foods, you could still be consuming too much sugar.

The health risks associated with excessive sugar consumption include weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. In fact, experts now believe that excessive sugar consumption may be one of the primary factors causing these chronic diseases.

So how do you cut back on sugar? The first step is to read food labels carefully and become aware of where hidden sugars can be found. Then begin gradually reducing the amount of sugary foods you eat each day until you reach your recommended limit. And finally, make sure to enjoy plenty of healthy foods like fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in sugar.
