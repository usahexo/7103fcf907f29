#  Valley Forge Casino Resort Plans to Extend Checkout Time

The Valley Forge Casino Resort is planning to extend checkout time for its guests.

According to a report from The Philadelphia Inquirer, the casino resort is looking to increase the checkout time from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.

"We're currently in the process of working with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board on an extension of our check-out time," said Paulissen. "We hope to have an answer in the near future."

Guests at the casino resort can currently check out at 11 p.m., but if the extension is granted, they will be able to stay until 2 a.m.

The Valley Forge Casino Resort is not the only casino in Pennsylvania looking to extend checkout times. The Rivers Casino in Schenectady, New York, recently announced that it would be increasing its checkout time from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.

#  Valley Forge Casino Resort Slots to Remain Open for 24 Hours

The Valley Forge Casino Resort in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania will continue to offer slot machine gaming around the clock, starting tomorrow, according to an announcement by casino officials. Starting at 8am on Friday, November 23rd and continuing until 8am on Monday, November 26th, guests will be able to enjoy all of the casino's 2,000 slots machines without interruption.

"This is something we're really excited about," said Dan Lee, the casino's Vice President of Slot Operations. "We know that many of our guests like to play slots late into the night or early in the morning, so having 24-hour gaming during this holiday weekend is going to be a real bonus for them."

The Valley Forge Casino Resort is one of only a handful of casinos in Pennsylvania to offer 24-hour gaming. In addition to its 2,000 slot machines, the casino also has 45 table games and a 250-seat entertainment venue.

“We want our guests to have a great experience while they’re with us, and we know that sometimes that means they need a little extra time,” said Ron Baumann, Chief Operating Officer of the Valley Forge Casino Resort. “We hope this policy will make their stay a bit more comfortable and enjoyable.”

Guests who wish to take advantage of the extended checkout time must request it at check-in. There is no additional charge for the service, and late checkout is subject to availability.
