#  How were the sunglasses designed?

Sunglasses are a type of eyewear that helps protect from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. They are typically worn when outside to prevent eye damage from the sun. The first sunglasses were created in China and were made from bamboo.

The modern sunglasses were invented in 1929 by American optician John L. Sullivan. He created the first pair of sunglasses with plastic frames and green lenses. The sunglasses were designed to protect the eyes of aviators from the sun's UV rays.

Since then, sunglasses have become increasingly popular and are now a necessary accessory for many people. Various styles of sunglasses have been created over the years, including wayfarers, aviators, and cat eyes.

Today, sunglasses come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. They are also made from different materials, such as plastic, metal, and wood. Most sunglasses feature lenses that block out UV radiation and help protect the wearer's eyes from the sun.

#  What materials were used in the construction of the sunglasses?

The sunglasses consist of a frame and lenses. The frame is typically made of metal, plastic, or a combination of the two. The lenses are made of either glass or plastic.

# What styles of sunglasses are available?

There are three main styles of sunglasses: aviator, wayfarer, and cat-eye. Aviator sunglasses are characterized by their thin metal frames and large lenses. Wayfarer sunglasses have thick frames and small lenses. Cat-eye sunglasses have frames that curve out at the top and bottom and lenses that are larger than the frames.

# How do you choose the right size and style of sunglasses?

To choose the right size and style of sunglasses, you first need to know your face shape. There are six different face shapes: round, oval, square, diamond, triangle, and heart. You can find out your face shape by looking in a mirror and tracing the outline of your face with a pencil. Once you know your face shape, you can then find the right size and style of sunglasses by looking at online sunglass retailers or by visiting a physical store.

#  How do the sunglasses fit?

When you are looking for a new pair of sunglasses, it is important to find a style and size that fit well. Sunglasses should fit comfortably on your face and not cause any irritation. Here are a few tips on how to find the perfect pair of sunglasses:

-First, consider the shape of your face. Some styles of sunglasses look better on certain face shapes than others. Oval faces look good with almost any style of sunglasses, while square shaped faces may want to choose a style with more curved edges.
