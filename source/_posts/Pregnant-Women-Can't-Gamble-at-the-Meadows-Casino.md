#  Pregnant Women Can't Gamble at the Meadows Casino

The Meadows Casino in Pittsburgh is a popular gambling destination, but pregnant women are now banned from the casino.

According to a new policy enacted by the casino, pregnant women are not allowed on the property. The casino says that the policy is in place for the safety of both the pregnant women and their unborn children.

Some people are criticizing the policy, saying that it's unfair to ban pregnant women from the casino. They argue that it's not the casino's responsibility to keep them safe and that they should be allowed to make their own decisions.

Others say that the policy is a wise decision, and that it's better to be safe than sorry. They argue that there's no need to take any risks when there's a potential for harm.

So far, there has been no comment from the Meadows Casino about the new policy.

#  Age Limit Increased to 72 at the Meadows Casino

The Meadows Casino in Washington County, Pennsylvania has announced that the age limit for its gaming and entertainment facilities is being increased from 65 to 72. The change was made official on Monday, December 3rd.

Meadows casino President Tony Matrazzo cited increased life expectancy as the rationale for the change. “As our guests continue to enjoy longer lifespans, we want to ensure that our amenities and services reflect that growing trend.”

The casino has not released information on when the new age limit will take effect, but signage indicating the change is already up at the property.

#  Dogs Are Not Allowed at the Meadows Casino

The Meadows Casino is a popular destination for many people in the area, but there’s one thing that you won’t be able to do there – bring your dog. That’s right, dogs are not allowed at the casino.

There are a few reasons for this policy. First and foremost, the casino wants to ensure that all of its guests feel comfortable and safe while they are there. Dogs can often be disruptive and may cause problems for other guests.

In addition, the casino wants to protect its employees. Dogs can be unpredictable and may attack or bite someone if they are feeling threatened or uncomfortable. This could lead to serious injuries for both the employee and the dog.

So if you’re looking to take your furry friend out for some fun, the Meadows Casino is not the place for you. However, there are plenty of other great places in the area where your dog will be welcome – just ask your vet for recommendations.

#  No More Children Allowed at the Meadows Casino

The Meadows Casino has announced that, as of September 1st, no more children will be allowed on the premises. This change comes as a result of increased complaints from casino guests about noise and disruption caused by small children.

Meadows Casino spokesperson Tara Peterman issued the following statement: “After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to no longer allow children into the casino. We understand that this may be disappointing for some families, but we hope they will understand that the safety and enjoyment of our guests is our top priority.”

Peterman also encouraged parents to take their children to other local attractions, such as the Children’s Museum or Kennywood amusement park.
