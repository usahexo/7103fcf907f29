<h1 id="European-Blackjack-Indonesia-easy-to-understand-rules-for-everyone"><a href="#European-Blackjack-Indonesia-easy-to-understand-rules-for-everyone" class="headerlink" title="European Blackjack Indonesia - easy to understand rules for everyone!"></a>European Blackjack Indonesia - easy to understand rules for everyone!</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. This game seems simple but be careful because it can be quite challenging. The object of the game is to draw cards until you reach a score of 21 or come as close as possible to this number without exceeding it. The player’s aim is to beat the dealer, not the other players at the table.</p>
<p>Like all card games, European blackjack Indonesia starts with each player being dealt two cards. The dealer will also give two cards - one face up and one face down. The face-up card is called the ‘upcard’ and the face-down card is called the ‘holecard’. After seeing their cards, players must decide whether they want to hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they have), double down (double their bet and receive just one more card), split (split their hand into two separate hands if they have two cards of the same rank) or surrender (give up and lose half their bet). In European blackjack Indonesia, players are allowed to double down on any two cards.</p>
<p>After all players have had their chance to act, the dealer will turn over their holecard. If their total sum is 16 or less, they must take another card (hit). If their sum goes over 21 then they bust and all players who are still in play win automatically - even if their own hand is lower than 21. If the dealer does not bust then the highest hand among the remaining players at the table wins - this could be a natural blackjack which pays out 3:2 or a hand containing more than 21 which is then compared according to standard poker rankings.</p>
<p>So that’s a basic overview of how to play European blackjack Indonesia. As you can see, it’s a relatively easy game to understand but there are plenty of strategic choices available for those who want to take things a little further! Why not try playing at an online casino today?</p>
